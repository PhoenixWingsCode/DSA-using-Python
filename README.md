👤 About Me
Hi, I’m Hiral Kanakhara — a passionate software developer and problem solver currently pursuing an MCA with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Amity University Online.

I have solved 400+ problems on LeetCode and have built this repository to serve as a structured and comprehensive resource for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Python. This repo shows my deep interest for learning DSA not just theoretically but with hands-on implementation and real problem-solving techniques.

🧠 I’m deeply interested in:

AI/ML Development

Full-stack Web Development

Competitive Programming

System Design

Open Source Projects
